# Using Cellular Automata to Model Forest Fire Spread
This project uses CAPyLE is a cross-platform teaching tool to help model the spread of Forest Fires. 

IN THIS GUIDE WE OUTLINE HOW TO RUN OUR SIMULATION AND THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS WE HAVE WRITTEN FOR OUR MODEL TO WORK. FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS ON THE FUNCTIONALITY OF CAPYLE PLEASE REFER TO THE CAPYLE DOCUMENTATION AT https://pjworsley.github.io/capyle/

THE KEY FUNCTIONALITY OF THE ASSIGNMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE forest_fire_sim.py in ca_descriptions

# Running the Simulation
1. Setup CAPyLE as instructed in the CAPyLE documentation mentioned above.
2. Run the program and open the main GUI.
3. Download the zip file submitted and move the forest_fire_sim.py file into the
ca_descriptions folder in your capyle folder
4. From the GUI select File>Open>ca_descriptions and select forest_fire_sim.py
5. Leave the Neighborhood, Initial Grid and Grid size as it is.
6. You could optiionally select as many generations as you would like, however it is
recommended to set it to 500 as that is what has been used in most of the tests
displayed in the report.
7. For further information on how to manipulate the GUI please refer to the CAPyLE
documentation linked above
